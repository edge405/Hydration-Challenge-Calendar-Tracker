# Our Hydration Challenge

## Why We’re Doing This

Nicole and I both have a bad habit—we don’t drink enough water. We get dehydrated so easily, and honestly, we just forget. Instead of dealing with dry throats and headaches all the time, we decided to **challenge ourselves** to build better hydration habits. And what better way to do it than together?

## The Rules Are Simple

- **Start Date:** January 20, 2025
- **End Date:** August 31, 2025
- **Penalty enforcement begins:** February 3, 2025

### Our Daily Water Goals

- **Edjay:** 4 liters
- **Nicole:** 3 liters  
  No excuses (unless it’s a legit emergency).

## Keeping Each Other Accountable 📸

Every day, we’ll **send a picture or video** of our water intake on Messenger. If we don’t report it, it doesn’t count.

## The Consequences (Aka: If We Slack Off) 🏃‍♂️

Miss a day? Time to **get moving**!

- **Jogging or walking penalty:** Starts at **1 km in February**, increasing by **500m each month**.
- **Must be done by the weekend**, with proof (video + fitness app screenshot).

### If We Don’t Do the Penalty…💸

We pay a **fine**, starting at **₱10** and increasing by **₱5 each month**.

## But There’s a Fun Part Too! 🎉

All the money from missed penalties goes into our **date fund**, so at the end of this challenge, we get to treat ourselves!

## Some Exceptions (Because Life Happens)

- If one of us gets **sick** or has a medical reason, we adjust the goal.
- **Emergencies** can be excused as long as we both agree.

Now there’s no excuse to forget! Let’s stay hydrated! 💙🚰

## Why This Matters ❤️

This challenge isn’t just about drinking water—it’s about **building good habits, staying healthy, and supporting each other**. We’re in this together, and no matter what happens, we’ll push each other to keep going.

So, here’s to **better hydration, better health, and a little bit of friendly competition**. Let’s do this! 💦
